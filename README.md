# Parsing Draw.io Diagrams

This project was part of my independent graduate research exploring how to
convert informal architecture artifacts (e.g. Draw.io diagrams) into
structured data that can be used for analysis and visualization.

To run the example, first install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the example:

```bash
python src/main.py
```
